    "A classical bit can exist in only one of two states: `0` or `1`, and this behavior is governed by the core principles of **classical physics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the fundamental unit in quantum computing is the **quantum bit (qubit)**, which stores **quantum information**.  \n",
    "Unlike classical bits, a qubit can be in the state $|0\\rangle$, the state $|1\\rangle$, or in a **superposition** of both states simultaneously.  \n",
    "These states are typically represented using **Dirac (ket) notation**, such as $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, and they follow the principles of **quantum mechanics**.\n",
